# This website is created using ReactJs
## Made By: **Rahul Soni**


## NPM Packages Used: 
* react-slick - For Carousel
* slick-carousel - For basic styling of Carousel
* react-responsive - For using CSS in JS Media-Queries
* react-router-dom - To give this single page site a multi-page look and feel.

## Pattern of Folder-Structure:
In this project I have seperated my folders into 3 main categories:
* **Assets** for Images
* **Component** for React Component that do not contain Main State (They may contain simple UI state)
* **hoc** Containers that wrap components and contain most of the UI state
* **Container** for storing all the Components with *important state*
